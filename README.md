Save the Humans - Protect Earth from Aliens! [C#]
How to Play

In "Save the Humans," your noble mission is to shield the helpless humans from the menacing alien invaders!

Getting Started

Commence your mission by pressing the "Start" button to launch the game.

Located in the top left corner, you'll find a lone "human." Click on it to pick it up (but don't hold on for too long!).

Rescue the Humans

Your primary objective is to escort the human to their designated home base, represented by a gray box.

Once you safely deliver the human to the home base, the box will vanish, reappearing in another area.

Your duty continues as you move to the new home base location and repeat the process.

Challenge Intensifies

Brace yourself for increasing difficultyâ€”each successful rescue prompts the aliens to quicken their pace.
Best of Luck!

As Earth's last line of defense, your skills will be put to the test. Wishing you the best of luck in your mission to Save the Humans!
